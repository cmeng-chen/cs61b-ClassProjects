cs61b Project2 - Line of Action

Author: Paul Hilfinger & Chen Meng

Description: Lines of Action is a board game invented by Claude Soucie. It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly
capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one group of pieces that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

CONTENTS:
	
Makefile		A makefile (for gmake) that will compile your
			files and run tests.  You must turn in a Makefile,
			'gmake ' must compile all your files, and 
			'gmake check' must perform all your tests.  
			Currently, this makefile is set up to do just 
			that with our skeleton files.  Be sure to keep 
			it up to date.
