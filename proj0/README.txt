cs61b Project0 - Canfield Solitaire

Author: Paul Hilfinger & Chen Meng

Description: Canfield (or Demon in England) was apparently introduced in the Canfield Casino in Saratoga Springs, New York. It's played with an ordinary deck of 52~playing cards. Initially, the player deals the cards as follows:

- 13 cards are dealt to a pile called the reserve, with only the top card face up.
- One card is dealt face up to the first of four foundation piles (the other three are initially empty).
- Four cards are dealt face up below the foundation to start four tableau piles.
- The remaining 34 cards (face down) form the stock.
- Next to the stock is an (initially empty) waste pile.

Task: 1.  provide an "undo" feature, allowing the player to take back a move
      2.  provide an alternative spiffy graphical user interface (GUI)
